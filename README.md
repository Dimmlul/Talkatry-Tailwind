## 📌 A Static Web

Talkatry is designed as a **static web application**, meaning that it is purely frontend-based and does not include any backend functionality, databases, or real-time server-side processing. It is built to showcase the UI and simulate an online psychiatry platform without handling actual consultations or data storage.
